# [Writing a Keylogger in Python from Scratch]
# keylogger.virus.exe
A simple python implementation of recording keystrokes typed using a physical keyboard.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** Python

**Server:** Not used

## Installation

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/anuragc2001/keylogger.virus.exe.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd keylogger.virus.exe
```

To run this:
```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Working
- Initially the keylogger is set to record all the keystrokes and appened the new keys with an intervel of 60 seconds.
- The file will be created in the root directory of the file itself
- The virus is harmless and only collects your keyboard data but can be further customised to record sound and mouse pointing vectors
- To stop the keylogger completely from your local machine use the task manager to kill the event manually
